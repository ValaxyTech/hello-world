Tool : containerization platform ( Docker+Kubernetes)

Docker == Containers ===Managing the containers is nothing but kubernetes 

Containers  ===> Light weight VM == VM -- virtual machine == AWS ec2 -instance ===Virtual machine 

containers == ec2-instance   Can be managed by kubernets ( Kubernetes is admin tool)

design and manage====> 

related cloud native tools.  === Kubernets == Open source and cloud native tool ( AWS EKS  == Elastic kubenertes service) /GKE/AKS

Open source Kubernetes ===> kubeadm / kops / Minikube 

private cloud ===> You are maintain a seperate network ( You are maintaining seperate IPS)
